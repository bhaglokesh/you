      "In a world cluttered with information, minimalism in web design is not just an aesthetic choice; it's a necessity. By stripping away the non-essential, we allow the content to shine and the user to focus on what truly matters.",
      "Cognitive load is real. When users are bombarded with popups, animations, and complex layouts, their ability to process information diminishes. Minimalist design respects the user's attention span.",
      "However, minimalism isn't just about removing things. It's about ensuring that every element on the screen serves a distinct purpose. Whitespace becomes an active element, guiding the eye and creating rhythm.",
      "In this project, I attempted to emulate the structure of a wiki entry. Why? Because it's a format we all know instinctively. It implies authority, structure, and clarity. By adopting these conventions, we lower the learning curve for new visitors.",
      "Key principles I followed: high contrast text for readability, strict typographic hierarchy, and limited color palette used only for interaction and semantic meaning."

    content: [
      "As React applications grow, the initial simplicity of 'useState' and 'useEffect' can quickly turn into a tangle of spaghetti code. Scaling requires intention and architectural discipline.",
      "One of the first patterns to adopt is the separation of concerns. Keep your components presentational. Move your business logic into custom hooks. This not only makes your components cleaner but also makes your logic testable and reusable.",
      "State management is another bottleneck. Do you really need Redux? Or Context? Often, server state (TanStack Query) and local state are enough. Don't over-engineer your global state store before you actually have global state problems.",
      "Performance optimization shouldn't be premature, but it should be continuous. Use the React DevTools Profiler. Memoize expensive calculations, but don't wrap every function in useCallback. Understand referential equality."

      "I was a power user of VS Code. I had my extensions, my snippets, and my themes. But I felt a ceiling. The mouse was slowing me down.",
      "Switching to Neovim wasn't about being cool; it was about speed of thought. When you can edit text at the speed you think, the editor disappears.",
      "The learning curve is steep, yes. But the investment pays off compound interest over years. Modal editing changes how you perceive text—not as a stream of characters, but as objects (words, sentences, paragraphs) to be manipulated.",
